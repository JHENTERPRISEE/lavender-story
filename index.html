    <p><b>My Lavender,</b> I still smile every time I call you that name...</p>

    <p>
      It’s funny how our story started with a simple “Hi” from a fake Instagram account.
      At that time, I had no idea that behind that name was a girl who would one day become
      my safest place...
    </p>

    <p>
      Then came that accidental meeting. Two shocked eyes staring at me on the stairs...
      The girl in the lavender T-shirt — unknowingly, the beginning of my whole world.
    </p>

    <p>
      From soft toys to our first kiss in the movie hall, from silence to destiny bringing
      us back again — loving you felt natural.
    </p>

    <p>
      Santiniketan became our escape. Lying on your arms while you played with my hair,
      I realized — you are my home.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re happy, I feel like I’ve won at life.  
      If you’re sad, my heart refuses to rest.
    </p>

      “We know everything is destiny, but behind every destiny,  
      I was there to change every destiny.”

    <p class="shayari">
      Tum hanso toh meri jeet hai,  
      Tum rootho toh meri haar.  
      Mera sukoon tumse shuru hota hai,  
      Aur tum pe hi hota hai khatam, Lavender.
